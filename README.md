# Twitter project

## How to run

### Dependencies

This script has been tested on `Node.js v16.14.0` on `Debian GNU/Linux`. It
needs Node.js version >16.

To run this script, you need an API key from Twitter. Once you have one, you
need to install the npm dependencies, then run the script with API_KEY as an
environment variable as to not hardcode it into the script. The next section
goes over how to install the necessary dependencies and run the script.

### Steps

1. `yarn` or `npm install` (prefer yarn)

2. `API_KEY=<twitter api key> node main.js`

3. `node test.js`
